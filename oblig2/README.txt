##Firstly added the project to github and then set up a action to run the test.
##Had to do some refactoring of some of the names in order to make it run properly.
##Then I had to make some adjustments to the files, some of them had created duplicates.
##And with duplicates it wouldnt run the tests.
##After all the files where cleaned up it ran well.
